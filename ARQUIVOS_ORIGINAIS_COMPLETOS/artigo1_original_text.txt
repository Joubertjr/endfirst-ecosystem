Psychologist Peter Gollwitzer’s work on the Implementation Gap highlights the
crucial difference between intention and action [5]. Over 200 studies have
validated this concept: most of us intend to act, but we fail to execute.
You want to go to the gym, but without a specific, pre-defined plan — when will
you go, where is the gym, how will you get there — the intention rarely translates
into reality. The linear model is good at defining what you want, but it’s terrible at
creating the systems needed to ensure you actually do it.
The Perfect Storm: These three forces — the Planning Fallacy, Decision
Fatigue, and the Implementation Gap — create a system failure that dooms most

resolutions.

The Perfect Storm: How These Forces Combine
Here’s what actually happens when you set a New Year’s resolution:
Day 1 (Planning Fallacy kicks in):
You set a goal like “go to the gym 5x/week” without realistically accounting for:
Late work meetings (which happen ~2x/week on average)
Social events (1–2/week)
Low-energy days (30% of days, according to sleep studies)
Realistic travel time (you assumed 10 minutes, but rush hour makes it 25)
Week 2 (Decision Fatigue kicks in):
Monday: You go to the gym.
Tuesday: After a tough day at work, you choose Netflix over the gym.
Wednesday: Now you feel guilty. This creates a new, draining decision:
“Should I skip again or try to break the guilt cycle?”
Each decision, especially those laced with guilt, costs mental energy. By
Thursday, you’re so decision-fatigued that your brain defaults to the path of least
resistance: comfort.
Core Idea: Guilt creates additional decisions, which accelerates decision
fatigue. It’s a vicious cycle.
Week 3 (Implementation Gap kicks in):
You still want to go to the gym. The intention is there. But you never decided:
WHEN (Mornings or evenings? What’s the backup time?)

WHERE (Which gym location is most convenient?)
WHAT (Which workout program will you follow?)
Without pre-defined “if-then” rules, the intention evaporates in the face of the
slightest friction.
Week 4 (The Downward Spiral):
You’ve now “failed” for three consecutive weeks. Your brain, a pattern-matching
machine, starts to label you as “someone who doesn’t follow through.” The initial
motivation is gone, replaced by a sense of failure. You quit.
Key Insight: This isn’t three separate problems. It’s one system failure with
three interconnected failure modes.

Diagnose Yourself: What’s YOUR Failure Mode?
Most people fail for all three reasons, but one is usually dominant. Here’s how to
identify yours:
You’re trapped by the Planning Fallacy if:
Your goals always seem “doable” when you set them.
You’re consistently shocked by how long things actually take.
You often find yourself saying, “I didn’t expect X to come up.”
→ Action: Build in a 40% buffer. If you think a task takes 10 hours, plan for 14. This
isn’t pessimism; it’s realism.
You’re trapped by Decision Fatigue if:
You start your days strong but fade by mid-day or mid-week.
You make progress when you’re rested but relapse when you’re stressed.

You have “good days” and “bad days” with no system to handle the bad days.
→ Action: Reduce in-the-moment decisions. Pre-commit to specific times and
actions so the choice is already made.
You’re trapped by the Implementation Gap if:
You know what to do but often don’t know when, where, or how.
Your goals are vague (“get healthy” vs. “lift weights on Mon/Wed/Fri at 7
a.m.”).
You wait for “the right moment” or “motivation to strike” instead of executing
a pre-defined plan.
→ Action: Use “if-then” planning. “If it’s Monday at 7 a.m., then I go to the gym, no
exceptions.” This automates the trigger for the behavior.
Most of us are a mix of all three. A robust system, like the ENDFIRST Method, is
designed to handle all three simultaneously.

Real Example: Why Sarah’s “Get Fit” Goal Failed
Let’s make this concrete. Sarah, a 34-year-old marketing manager, set a
resolution: “Exercise 4x/week and lose 15 lbs by June.”
What she did (Linear Model):
Jan 1: Signed up for a gym membership.
Jan 2–7: Went 4 times.
Jan 8–14: A work project exploded. She only went once.
Jan 15–21: Felt guilty and behind, didn’t go at all.
Jan 22: Canceled her gym membership, feeling defeated.

Diagnosis:
Planning Fallacy: She didn’t account for Q1 being her busiest quarter every
year, the 45-minute commute to the gym during rush hour, or the lack of a
childcare plan for evenings.
Decision Fatigue: After 10-hour workdays and parenting, she had zero mental
energy left to “decide” to go to the gym. The couch always won.
Implementation Gap: She never defined when she would go (mornings?
evenings?), what workout she would do (cardio? weights?), or a backup plan if
the gym was closed or she was short on time.
Core Idea: Sarah would still have tough weeks. But the system is designed to
handle them, not her willpower.
What an ENDFIRST approach would look like:
1. END (Identity-based):
“By June, I am someone who moves my body for 30 minutes, 5 days a week, in a
way that energizes me.”
2. SYSTEM (Reverse-engineered):
Friction Removal: Use home workouts to eliminate the commute.
Time-Blocking: Schedule workouts for 6:30 a.m. daily, before the kids wake
